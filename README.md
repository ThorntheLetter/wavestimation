# wavestimation

So I had an experiment planned out, and started writing haskell code for it,
but then I realized that I did not have data, know where I am going to get it, or what format it would be in.
So instead of just finding or making data, I wrote the first part again in python, and also made it parallel and wrote test code.

So until I get data, I might write the generic functions in more languages and/or improve current code.

Current Languages:
Haskell
Python
